<br>

<p style="font-family:verdana;">Youtube first launched Februaury 14th of 2005. Youtube was found by Jawad Karim, Steve Chen and Chad Hurley. Former paypal employees and entrepreneur. They sold youtube to Google for 1.65 billion back in 2006.   </p>
<ul>
<li style="font-family:verdana;">Advantages </li>
<p style="font-family:verdana;"> Youtube is not only free to use, but it allows content creators or anyone (in general) to have an opportunity to earn money from getting views on you're videos. Videos can go from music, animations, vlogs and anything that you're heart desires. Youtube also provides a feature where users can provide links to their social media's, contact, products, offer services etc in their profile bio or within their video description, where viewers can easily see and access by a click of a button. </p>
<li style="font-family:verdana;">
  Disadvantages </li>
<p style="font-family:verdana;"> Youtube has many advantages for anyone to roll over and join at anytime, nevertheless, it has many downsides. One disadvantage is that once you upload a public video, it is public. Many big youtubers have posted a video and have received harmful comments and backlash on their content depending on if people find the video offensive or not. Everyone has their own opinion at the end of the day. Another thing about the platform is that theres many rules that content creators must follow. If they don't follow their guidelines, they can get their channel banned. Another problem is copyright, if you include a song even a second of it, your video can get taken down. Youtube can be very tricky when it comes to creating content or building off of other content creators. </p>
